<h1>My Journey to Web Development.</h1>

<p> <strong><em>TL;DR: Teachers bring a lot of skills to the table. I'll add value to your team</strong></em>.</p>


  <p>After studying science for four years at the College of William and Mary, I decided to pursue a career in high school science education. I loved the idea of being able to instill a passion for science in young minds and help students, who may not have found science subjects accessible in the past, find a connection with the subject matter. Some things I loved about teaching were getting to build relationships with new students and my colleagues year after year, as well as finding creative ways to deliver content in a fun and engaging manner.
  </p>

  <p>At the conclusion of seven years in the classroom, I’ve decided to take my passion for problem solving and relationship building and begin a career as a web developer. When starting to look into new careers, that provided more room for professional growth, web development really stood out to me. This career will allow an intersection between my strong analytical and problem solving skills with my ability to communicate and collaborate with teammates. </p>

  <p>My time in the classroom has provided me with many valuable skills that are transferable to a web developer role. What I feel is most important from my time in the classroom to my future role as a web developer, is my adaptability. Despite having lesson plans outlined well in advance, there are sometimes things that happen in a classroom that are unforeseen. If setbacks do occur during the project duration, I can adapt quickly and think on my feet to compensate for the setback. By being able to quickly adapt to changes, I will be better able to support business goals with being able to think on my feet and still deliver quality work.
  </p>

  <p>While adaptability will be a great asset as a web developer, I have also developed other transferable skills such as excellent communication skills. I have to clearly communicate with users, stakeholders, and other members of my team on a daily basis. This communication includes, but is not limited to, emails, phone calls, interviews, and in-person conversations.
  </p>

  <p>Additionally, I’ve developed skills as an effective public speaker - able to take a deliverable and explain the highlights in an efficient and effective manner. I've had to use these presentation skills on a daily basis with students in the classroom and also when discussing my students' growth over the year with stakeholders at the school level (principal and assistant principals).
  </p>

  <p>These experiences in emphasizing the value of clear communication and presention of information as well as developing strong analytical skills will aid in developing code to solve business needs.
